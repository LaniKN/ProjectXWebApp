Such topics as working with an international sample; collaborating with international scholars; cultural philosophical assumptions and frames of references and their influence of theory development; challenges with a concept translation; and publication standards in international scholarly outlets are among a few topics examined in the course. This course will also enable students to evaluate generalizability of research finding in Western leadership studies. Finally, students will analyze leadership studies published by scholars from Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Middle East. Applications for theory development as well as for leadership development will be discussed. ",

This course will review the most relevant challenges we face as an aging society. At no other time in the world's history have we experienced the sheer numbers of older adults living today and the expectations that a large majority of Americans will live longer than we have previously experienced. Students will focus on how social scientists build knowledge and understanding through theory development and testing, and introduce the evolution of theoretical thought from a social science perspective. The major issues affecting an aging society are addressed, including how theoretical perspectives predict how society may change as larger numbers of people are classified in older age groups. The life course perspective, and the implications of early life events in affecting later life decisions are addressed, as are cultural differences in intergenerational exchanges. ",

The essential components of a successful BMS are high accuracy in data measurement which include proper use of analog-to-digital converters and their instrumentation. Interpreting this data using a micro-controller allows output control signals and communication of the interpreted data. The output control signal tells relays to disconnect the battery during fault conditions and the communication tells users the condition of the battery/BMS through human machine interfaces. The circuitry, communication strategies, and advanced BMS control provide a more optimized BMS and gives student a reference design on how to make their own BMS. Understanding these components gives students a more advanced understanding of the technology by taking a closer look into BMSs. ",
